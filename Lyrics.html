    <h1>Wont be late</h1>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 128, 122)">Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off) <br/>
It just dawned on me (on me), this right, feels wrong <br/>
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game <br/>
At this game, two can play <br/>
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right <br/>
Baby, don't fight it, you're giving me life <br/>
Take your time, set the mood right 
Settle down, skeptical at first, but now I'm not <br/>
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey) <br/>
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah) <br/>
Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you <br/>
Suddenly I freed up (Free) <br/>
Freezing my times with you <br/>
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up <br/>
Closed off my line for you (closing down my line) <br/>
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl <br/>
Standin' in line for you (Standin' in line for you) <br/>
Standin' here for I don't know how long, girl <br/>
Things I wrote (Ayy), lengths I go <br/>
Let's you know that I want you <br/>
Words we spoke (Yeah), things you wrote <br/>
Let me know that you want me too (Yeah)
Ikebe, pressing on me heavy <br/>
Pressing up against me real close <br/>
Bakassi, moving on me wassy <br/>
Time is moving real slow <br/>
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey) <br/>
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah) <br/>
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey) <br/>
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)</p>
